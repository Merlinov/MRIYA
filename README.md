#Features
- simple and clean design (fully optimized for wireless)
- comfortable thumb cluster (inspired by jian: https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info)
- convenient reset buttons (on the top plate)
- native nice!view support
- aggressive pinky stagger
- no LEDs
- Hot-swap MX
- QMK/ZMK support (any crkbd-compatible firmware will work)

# Issues I found
- Controllers (especially Chinese ProMicro) longer than 35mm will stick out a little from the mcu cover
- Required thickness for the bottom fr4 plate at least 1.6mm because of construction specifics (only 4 mounting points)
- MT3 Ortho sets aren't suitable bacause of 1.25u keys in thumb cluster
