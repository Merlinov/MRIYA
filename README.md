## Features
- Design optimized for wireless
- Updated thumb cluster (inspired by [jian](https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info))
- Reset buttons
- Native nice!view support
- Updated pinky stagger
- No LEDs
- Hot-swap MX
- QMK/ZMK support

## Possible issues
- Controllers longer than 35mm (ProMicro from AliExpress) will stick out from the cover
- Required thickness for the bottom fr4 plate at least 1.6mm because of construction specifics (only 4 mounting points)
- Limited keycap compatibility (e.g. MT3 ortho sets) because of the 1.25u thumb keys
