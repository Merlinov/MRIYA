## Features
- Simple and clean design (fully optimized for wireless)
- Comfortable thumb cluster (inspired by [jian](https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info))
- Convenient reset buttons
- Native nice!view support
- Aggressive pinky stagger
- No LEDs
- Hot-swap MX
- QMK/ZMK support (any crkbd-compatible firmware will work)

## Issues I found
- Controllers longer than 35mm will stick out a little from the mcu cover
- Required thickness for the bottom fr4 plate at least 1.6mm because of construction specifics (only 4 mounting points)
- MT3 Ortho sets aren't suitable bacause of 1.25u keys in thumb cluster
